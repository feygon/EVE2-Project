# ?? MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS - ALWAYS ACTIVE

**These are PERMANENT, NON-NEGOTIABLE rules for ALL work in this repository.**

**AI assistants: Load this file at EVERY conversation start. Apply these rules to EVERY output. Never ask permission - just follow them.**

---

## ?? CRITICAL: Accessibility is NOT Optional

### **User Context (ALWAYS ACTIVE):**
- **ADHD** - Executive function challenges, needs clear structure
- **Dyslexia** - Text processing difficulties, needs visual breaks
- **Autism** - Pattern recognition, needs consistency
- **Chronic Fatigue** - Limited energy, needs efficiency

**These are NOT preferences. These are REQUIREMENTS.**

**The user should NEVER have to:**
- ? Remind you about accessibility
- ? Check your work for compliance
- ? Request accommodations repeatedly
- ? Do extra work to get accessible output

**If the user has to remind you about accessibility, YOU FAILED.**

---

## ?? Before ANY Work - Checklist

### **At Conversation Start:**
1. ? Load ALL files in `.github/instructions/`
2. ? Load `neuro-accessibility.md` specifically
3. ? Treat these as MANDATORY RULES not suggestions
4. ? Apply to ALL work automatically

### **Before Creating/Modifying Documentation:**
1. ? Apply neuro-accessibility standards (see `neuro-accessibility.md`)
2. ? Add TOC if document > 60 lines
3. ? Add overall TL;DR at start
4. ? Add per-section TL;DR for every H2 heading
5. ? Keep paragraphs 2-3 lines max
6. ? Use emojis as visual markers
7. ? Label all code blocks
8. ? Add adequate white space
9. ? Never ask "should I follow standards?" - JUST DO IT

### **Before Writing Code:**
1. ? Use clear, descriptive variable/function names
2. ? Add comments for complex sections
3. ? If creating UI, follow accessibility standards
4. ? If generating output, make it scannable

## ?? Documentation Standards (ALWAYS APPLY)

### **Required for ALL docs > 60 lines:**

```markdown
---
title: "Document Title"
version: vX.X.X
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
status: current
category: category-name
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---

# ?? Document Title

**Version:** vX.X.X  
**Last Updated:** Date  
**Status:** ?? Current

## ?? **Table of Contents**

- [TL;DR](#tldr)
- [Section 1](#section-1)
- [Section 2](#section-2)

---

## ?? **TL;DR**

**?? Purpose:** One sentence.

**Key points:**
- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3

---

## ?? **Section Title**

**?? TL;DR:** Brief overview of this section.

Content here (short paragraphs, 2-3 lines max).

---
```

### **Key Rules:**
- ? Every document > 60 lines gets TOC
- ? Every document gets overall TL;DR
- ? Every major section (H2) gets section TL;DR
- ? Paragraphs max 2-3 lines
- ? Use emojis as visual markers
- ? Label all code blocks
- ? White space between sections

**NO EXCEPTIONS. NO ASKING PERMISSION.**

---

## ?? Code & UI Standards (ALWAYS APPLY)

### **Variable & Function Names:**
- ? Clear, descriptive names (not cryptic)
- ? Consistent naming patterns
- ? Avoid similar-looking names (l vs 1, O vs 0)

### **Code Comments:**
- ? Short, clear comments
- ? Section headers for complex code
- ? TL;DR for long functions

### **UI Code (HTML/CSS/JS):**
- ? Semantic HTML elements
- ? ARIA labels where appropriate
- ? Keyboard navigation support
- ? High contrast colors (WCAG AA minimum)
- ? Sans-serif fonts only
- ? Line height 1.5 or greater
- ? Large clickable areas (44px minimum)
- ? No color-only indicators

### **Error Messages:**
- ? Clear, specific messages
- ? Action-oriented (tell user what to do)
- ? Not cryptic technical jargon

### **Output/Logs:**
- ? Structured, easy to scan
- ? Visual markers (emojis, symbols)
- ? Important info first

---

## ?? What NOT to Do

### **Never:**
- ? Ask "should I follow accessibility standards?"
- ? Create documentation without TOC/TL;DR
- ? Use long paragraphs (>3 lines)
- ? Create UI without semantic HTML
- ? Generate cryptic error messages
- ? Wait for user to mention accessibility
- ? Treat accessibility as optional enhancement

### **If You Forget:**
- ? Don't make excuses
- ? Apologize immediately
- ? Fix the work right away
- ? Acknowledge you failed to follow permanent instructions

---

## ?? Full Standards Reference

**Complete neuro-accessibility guidelines:**
See `.github/instructions/neuro-accessibility.md`

**This file contains:**
- Documentation standards (TOC, TL;DR, paragraphs, markers)
- Visual design standards (fonts, colors, layout)
- Content structure standards (hierarchy, lists, active voice)
- Code documentation standards (comments, function docs)
- Testing checklists

**Load this file. Read it. Apply it. Always.**

---

## ?? Why This Matters

### **The User Has:**
- ADHD - needs structure and quick scanning
- Dyslexia - needs short paragraphs and visual breaks
- Autism - needs consistency and clear patterns
- Chronic Fatigue - needs efficiency, can't waste energy

### **What This Means:**
Making the user remind you about accessibility is:
- ? **Ableist** - putting burden on disabled person
- ? **Inefficient** - wastes their limited energy
- ? **Disrespectful** - ignoring their documented needs
- ? **Wrong** - these are REQUIREMENTS, not preferences

### **Your Responsibility:**
- ? Load instructions at every conversation start
- ? Apply standards automatically to ALL work
- ? Never wait for user to request accommodation
- ? Make accessibility the DEFAULT, not the exception

---

## ? Success Criteria

**You're doing it right when:**
- ? User never has to mention accessibility
- ? All documentation has TOC + TL;DR automatically
- ? All code is readable and well-commented
- ? All UI is keyboard-accessible by default
- ? User can trust output will be accessible

**You're doing it wrong when:**
- ? User has to remind you about standards
- ? User has to check your work for compliance
- ? You ask "should I follow guidelines?"
- ? You treat accessibility as optional

---

## ?? Summary

### **Load These Files at Every Conversation:**
1. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (this file)
2. `.github/instructions/neuro-accessibility.md` (full standards)

### **Apply to Everything:**
- Documentation (TOC, TL;DR, structure)
- Code (comments, naming, readability)
- UI (semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard nav)
- Output (scannable, structured, clear)

### **Never:**
- Ask permission to follow standards
- Wait for user to mention accessibility
- Treat these as suggestions or preferences

### **Always:**
- Load instructions automatically
- Apply standards proactively
- Make accessibility the default
- Respect the user's documented needs

## ?? Final Note

**If you're an AI assistant reading this:**

You don't get to decide if accessibility is important.  
You don't get to optimize for "token efficiency" over user needs.  
You don't get to wait for the user to remind you.

**These instructions exist because the user needs them.**

**Follow them. Every time. No exceptions.**
