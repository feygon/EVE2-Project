# ?? Quick Process Card - Keep This Visible!

## The 6-Phase Process (In Order)

```
1. FIX    ??  ? Fix what's broken
2. SECURE ??  ? Remove hardcoded secrets
3. ORGANIZE ?? ? Clean up the mess
4. ACCESS ?  ? Make it readable
5. NAVIGATE ??? ? Create portal/index
6. DEPLOY ??  ? Push to production
```

## One Phase Per Session

**Don't do everything at once!**

Pick one, finish it, commit, then stop.

Tomorrow = next phase.

---

## After Each Phase

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Phase X: [what you did]"
git push
```

**Small commits = good commits**

---

## Accessibility Checklist (Phase 4)

For EVERY document > 60 lines:

- [ ] Table of Contents at top
- [ ] TL;DR for complex stuff
- [ ] Paragraphs = 2-3 lines max
- [ ] Visual breaks (`---`)
- [ ] Emojis for markers
- [ ] Code blocks labeled
- [ ] White space everywhere

---

## When Stuck

**Ask yourself:**
1. "What phase am I on?" (1-6)
2. "What's the next checklist item?"
3. "Can I do just that one thing?"

**Still stuck?**
? Open `PROJECT_IMPROVEMENT_PROCESS.md`
? Find your phase
