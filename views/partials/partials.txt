Partial template improves GP non-redundancy.
Cut out repeated code, and insert comment.
script call to partials id, with html code.
register partial template in javascript (same place you register routes)

back in index.html, (main.handlebars?), add in partial, e.g.: {{> partialName}} -- use the name we gave the partial when we registered it (possibly camelCasePartial vs. #id-dash-delimited-partial)

Still had to include the script on both pages. So we didn't solve our redundancy problem, did we? Maybe even complicated it more. Buuuuut...

we can use the same template twice on the same page.

Use server side code to include that chunk of code in a separate file.
In .net world, could renderpage.
In phpworld, <?php include?>, etc.
Just go get it with server-side code.
What if there's no server?

One thing we can do in javascript is ajax it in. (hack!)

copy script into new file -- save & call new html file, save to views/partials folder
leave partial call

ajax in character details partial.
$.ajax("./character-details-partial.html").done(function(charDetailsPartial)) {
	@("body").append(charDetailsPartial);
});

move registerpartial after page.

This doesn't append it to rendering in the body! I appends the partial SCRIPT code that you've registered onto the page.

{{this}} in a {{#each}} {{/each}} block accesses each array entry in the root of a context, if it has no key attribute. Such as: 
var bla = {
	"bow" [
		"wow",
		"bark",
		"bam"
	]
}, which references 'wow' and 'bar' as string array cells instead of properties

instead of:
var bla = {
	"bow": [
		{
			"name": "wow",
			"sound": "ruff"
		},
		{
			"name": "waroo",
			"sound": "arf"
		},
		{
			"name": "takeA",
			"sound": "splat"
		}
	]
}, which would be dereferenced by its inner properties like name and sound.
